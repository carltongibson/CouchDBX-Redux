CouchDBX-Redux
==============

Work in progress repo for the resurrection of CouchDBX — A Mac OS X wrapper for CouchDB

This is a reimplementation of the work originally done By Jan Lehnardt and others. See <https://github.com/couchbase/couchdbx-app>.

The current status of this version is "exploratory work".

Installation and Usage
----------------------
The original version of CouchDBX packaged Erlang and CouchDB. That's our goal.

For the moment though this version relies on a `homebrew` installation of CouchDB to function.

1. Please follow the instructions at <https://gist.github.com/2147079> to install CouchDB with Homebrew.

2. Build CouchDBX-Redux in Xcode and run.

Issues
------
1. Packaging Erlang and CouchDB.
2. What features should the app have?

Please contribute/comment here or on the <dev@couchdb.apache.org> mailing list.
